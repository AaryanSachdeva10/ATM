# ATM
A mini ATM using Java, Arduino, and NFC technology. Each account is linked to a unique NFC card, connecting the physical and digital worlds. The ATM's core logic, including transactions, is implemented in Java and displayed via a Swing interface. Account data is managed with a simple CSV-based storage mechanism.
